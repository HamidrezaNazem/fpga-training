# Using FPGAs with oneAPI Lab

1. If you do not have a IntelÂ® DevCloud account, sign up for one at this [website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/forms/idz/devcloud-registration.html?tgt=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/forms/devcloud-enrollment/account-provisioning.html). Use the event code from your event if you have been given one.

2. Once you have an Intel DevCloud account, go to the [Get Started page](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/) and scroll to the bottom. Click on the "Sign In to Connect" button shown below that is beneath the "Connect with Jupyter* Notebook" heading.
